# written elsewhere

# don't forget about hole detection in the outliner

# for tail handling, once you find a tail by reaching the end, make the new shape,

# do the whole thing with if the tail changes directon, then once you get back to start, the direction change could have cause another perim to be missed, so call reg fcn on that point to find more stuff

# so once tail changes direction, draw triangle. Call regular fcn on that new point, you don't need to know you are on a tail (i think)
